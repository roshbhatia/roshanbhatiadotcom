## Why Static Websites?

Static websites have several advantages:

1. **Fast Performance**: No server-side processing needed for each request
2. **Improved Security**: Fewer attack vectors compared to dynamic sites
3. **Lower Cost**: Hosting static sites is often cheaper or free
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to develop, deploy, and maintain

## Using htmx and fx.hot.page

This site uses a combination of htmx for interactivity and fx.hot.page for styling. This allows for a clean, modern interface without heavy JavaScript frameworks.

```javascript
// Sample code
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
});
```
